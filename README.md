# ml-webApp
### This project contains a Linear Regression machine learning algorithm as a backend part. For connecting it with front end I have used Python Flask server.

*For Front End I have used HTML and CSS and with that I have created a simple landing page where you need to enter 3 values which are like 
1)Engine Size 
2)Numbers of cylinders
3)Fuel
After entering this values then _Machine Learning_ algorithm will run at backend part and then you will get the minimum Carbon Dioxide emission from vehical. *

#### I have deploy it on Herokuu server. Here is the link  https://machinelearningwebapp.herokuapp.com/ 

# This project is totally Open Source if you want to improve either design or Algorithm then do fork this repo and sent pull request.
